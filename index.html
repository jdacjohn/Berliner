                At Berliner and Associates Architecture (BAA) our goal is to create buildings and spaces that enhance our client's lives and their unique culture and goals. Founded in 1996, BAA has provided quality services to clients throughout Southern California. During that time we have developed solid partnerships with our clients through shared creativity and vision.
                </P><P>
                We are a full-service design firm with expertise in Master Planning, Architecture, Interior Design, and Environmental Graphics. In addition, we integrate our expertise in the areas of sustainable design, LEED compliance, and ADA compliance.
                </P><P>
                Every design we create is deeply rooted in the functional and programmatic needs of our clients and the context in which the project fits. Whether the project is a new structure or a renovation, we make great efforts to understand the existing structures, environment, and needs of our clients as a starting point from which the design may evolve.
                </P><P>
                This results in an understandable, consensus-building process through the collaboration of all of the team members. Using our design sensibilities and experience in creating successful design solutions, we are able to incorporate the diverse needs and visions of a community into a cohesive, functional, and successful environment that reflects the dreams of our clients.

                Richard Berliner - Richard grew up in New York City where his love of cities  and buildings evolved over many years of walking around the city and admiring buildings and spaces. Always fascinated with the history of buildings and how people use them, Richard attended Rhode Island School of Design and received a Bachelor of Architecture in 1979. His apprenticeship was spent designing public and private buildings, master plans and interiors at large firms in Los Angeles. Working with our clients to understand their needs and dreams, Richard, along with the design team, develops solutions that grow from how people will live in buildings and spaces over their lifetime. Richard believes that architectural style is one tool to express people's dreams and that the essence of architecture is in the order, space and light that evolve from understanding clients and how they will live in the spaces we create. Richard is a LEED-accredited professional.
                <BR>Mike Frey - Mike, a Northern California native, began his interest in building as a boy while working on projects with his father. He began working in computer-aided drafting in the early eighties, which led him into systems management for a large San Francisco firm. Mike moved to Los Angeles in 1985 to focus on architecture. While working for a large architectural firm he met Richard Berliner and together they founded Berliner and Associates Architecture in 1996. Mike is a project architect with over 24 years of technical expertise producing Construction Documents. He lives in Los Angeles with his wife Anne. Mike is a LEED-accredited professional and a licensed California Architect.

She received her Bachelor's of Arts in Architecture and Fine Arts and Bachelor's of Architecture degrees from Rice University in Houston, Texas. Upon graduation she won a traveling fellowship that gave her the opportunity to travel Europe for three months and see monumental architecture first hand. Prior to joining Berliner, she worked in Georgia, New Jersey, and North Carolina designing commercial, education, religious and community buildings.  Brooke relocated to California in 2006.  She is LEED accredited and licensed in North Carolina. Brooke loves the complex challenges of architectural practice and enjoys team based collaborations to design architecture for the every day.

                <BR>Marco Excudero - Marco became interested in architecture because it was a field that allowed him to be creative and rational at the same time, something between a designer and an engineer. He completed his six-year architectural degree at the University of Santiago de Chile. After he received his degree he went on to receive a certificate in Restoration of Historical Centers at UISEK and a certificate in Real Estate Appraisal at the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile. Marco started his career working for Pascal Cheetham Architects for two years, primarily designing hotels. In September of 2007, he moved to California to marry his wife, and to start his career here in the U.S. Marco has been working for Berliner and Associates since June 2008 and is currently working on revalidating his architectural degree and is LEED-accredited.
                <BR>Michelle Paige Ford - After receiving an AA in Interior Design from Santa Monica College's regional Interior Design Program, Michelle's focus was on residential design before joining Berliner & Associates Architecture in 2000.

Designing with sustainability as a motivation and by selecting green materials are a frequent practice. She is a native to California, and for her whole life Michelle has had an interest and concern for the health of the environment.

After graduation, he was persuaded to pursue architecture through inspiring visits to the studio of a friend who was enrolled in a design program.  He was accepted into the School of Architecture at The University of California, Los Angeles, and graduated with a Masters degree in 1992. Since graduation, Mark has worked at a number of Southern California design firms, working on a broad range of residential, educational, entertainment, and commercial projects.

His interest in urban design and the creation of public space has led to his involvement as lead designer in projects ranging from entertainment/retail centers, transit-oriented mixed-use developments, and signage programs for major airports. Before joining BAA in 2004, Michael was instrumental in the  planning and design of the Las Vegas Monorail and the Chinatown Station of the Los Angeles Metro Gold Line, both of which were seen as catalysts for generating new urban development in their surrounding areas.  His work is characterized by its attention to the "personal" details of large-scale developments which bring color, interest, and variety to the daily life of the prople who use them. Michael is a LEED-accredited professional.
                <BR>Lori Odino - Though Lori exhibited a talent for design at a very young age, when she built a Barbie house out of cardboard and furniture for it out of Kleenex boxes, her early career was more academic than artsy. She received her BA in Psychology from UCLA and her MBA in Financial Management from USC. She subsequently worked for various companies, including Hughes Aircraft, CBS and Hilton Hotels.  For her first job in the design world she managed a small architectural firm and served as its interior designer, while attending the UCLA Interior and Environmental Design Program at night.
